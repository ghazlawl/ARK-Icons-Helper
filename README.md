## How-to

Will update this later. Long story short, do this:

2. Add delay.
3. Set the floor material to green (or black), should be pre-selected.
4. Add delay.
5. Call function on IconsHelper object to move the player to a structure.
6. Look at the structure and take a screenshot.
7. Repeat Steps 4-6 until done.
