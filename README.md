A blueprint library used to create icons for structures.

## How-to

Will update this later. Long story short, do this:

1. Pre-place structures in the Viewport.
2. Create IconsHelper object.
3. Add delay.
4. Set the floor material to green (or black), should be pre-selected.
5. Add delay.
6. Call function on IconsHelper object to move the player to a structure.
7. Look at the structure and take a screenshot.
8. Repeat Steps 5-7 until done.
